        projectName: 'DES VS AES ALGORITHM USING NETWORK SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY',
        projectDesc: 'This thesis, "DES vs AES Algorithm Using Network Security and Cryptography," compares the performance and security of DES and AES, focusing on speed, block size, key size, and attack resistance. Through Java simulations, AES is found to be more secure and efficient than DES and 2DES, making it better suited for modern applications. The study suggests future research in post-quantum cryptography and blockchain integration.',
